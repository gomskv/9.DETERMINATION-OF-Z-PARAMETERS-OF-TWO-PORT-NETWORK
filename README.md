**THEORY:**

A two-port network is an electrical circuit or device with two pairs of terminals. This makes possible the isolation of either a complete circuit or part of it. They are important in modeling electronic devices and system components.

In Z parameters of a two-port, the input & output voltages V1& V2 can be expressed in terms of input & output currents I1& I2. Out of four variables (i.e V1, V2, I1, I2) V1& V2 are dependent variables whereas I1& I2 are independent variables. Thus,
V1 = Z11I1+Z12I2	(1)


V2 =  Z21I1 +Z22I2	(2)


Here Z11& Z22 are the input & output driving point impedances while Z12& Z21 are the reverse & forward transfer impedances.
 



**PROCEDURE:**

a)	Connect the circuit as shown in fig. & switch ‘ON’ the experimentalboard.
b)	First open the O/P terminal & supply 5V to I/P terminal. Measure O/P Voltage & I/P Current.
c)	Secondly, open I/P terminal & supply 5V to O/P terminal. Measure I/P Voltage & O/P current usingmulti-meter.
d)	Calculate the values of Z parameter using Equation (1) &(2).
e)	Switch ‘OFF’ the supply after taking thereadings.


**RESULT:**

The Z-parameters of the two port network has been calculated and verified by using Multisim Simulator.
